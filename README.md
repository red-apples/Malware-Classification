## Abstract to project

The purpose of machine learning could be said to be its automatic method, defined as learning and improving despite not being explicitly programmed. However, applications of machine learning in cyber security are far from automatic. Malware authors use various evasion techniques to produce changes within malicious files to avoid detection.  

Within this project, opcodes are utilised as an input into an artificial neural network, to detect various families of malware from benignware. Opcodes are portions of machine language which instruct which operation are to be performed; they lie within every file that performs an action. Using these trained models, how a malware author may use opcodes to perform an adversarial attack are considered and implemented. The results show successful classification of malware and benign at a 91\% accuracy. 

Further results show how great a perturbation of data is required to reduce accuracy of classifiers down to a 52\% accuracy, by appending opcodes onto the end of files. These results allow for further research in utilising opcodes for classification of malware, whilst allowing security researchers to consider how opcodes can also be utilised to evade classifiers.
